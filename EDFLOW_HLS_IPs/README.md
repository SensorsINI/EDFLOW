This folder includes the Vivado HLS projects for two core IPs: ABMOF and SFAST.

Using Vivado HLS to open them and then synthesis and run C/RTL simulation.
The version of Vivado HLS we used here is 2018.1. 

After synthesie, the IP files could be exported from Vivado HLS.
Copy these IP files to the IP folder in EDFLOW_Vivado_prj to update them in the Vivado project.
